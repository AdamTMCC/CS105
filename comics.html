            <p>Here is a picture of part of my collection. At the time I took this, there were 40 boxes, but I'm up to
                44 now.</p>
            <p>There are 6629 individual comics in there as of today (the <a href="statistics.html">statistics</a> page
                shows 6780 because there are some duplicates), and that number increases by a dozen or so each week when
                new comics come out on Wednesdays. I've read almost all of them, and the ones I have not read are in
                the long boxes at the lower-right. They will get moved to the small boxes after they've been read. I am
                strict with myself about not putting anything into what I call the "main collection" until it has been
                read.</p>
