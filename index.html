            <p>Hello, my name is Adam and I like comic books. Over the years, I've amassed quite a collection. Click <a
                    href="comics.html">here</a> to see a picture of part of the collection, or <a
                    href="statistics.html">here</a> to see
                some statistics.</p>
            <p>Below is a picture of the comic of which I am most proud: X-Men #3, from 1964. The plastic case it's
                in is called a slab. Comics are slabbed after they are professionally graded to ensure that they stay in
                the assigned condition. This one is a 2.0 on a scale of 0.1-10. 0.1 comics are generally single pages
                (often considered valuable when signed by someone like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee"
                    target="_blank">Stan Lee</a>), 0.5 books are usually coverless, and from 1.0 up to the usual maximum
                of 9.8, are intact and in increasingly better condition as you go up the scale. Comics are very, very
                rarely assigned a grade of 10, or "gem mint". Grades of 2 or 3 are pretty common for comics as old as
                this one.</p>
